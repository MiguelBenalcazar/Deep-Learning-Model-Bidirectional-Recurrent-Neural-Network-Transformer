With the rise of the internet and mobile devices, push notifications
have become a powerful marketing tool for e-commerce and media websites. Push 
notifications are short messages that pop up on the user’s mobile or desktop, nudging 
them to take some action. There are usually three important stages: push(an app 
owner sends a push notification to users) impression(user receives the push 
notification on their device) click (user clicks or not after receiving the impression.)
And click-through rate (CTR) is one of the most important push notification 
performance metrics. In this homework, our goal is to predict the probability that a 
user will click after receiving each push notification.
*Click-through rate (CTR) represents the number of notifications that were clicked 
out of the total notifications that were successfully received. 
In this homework, the dataset is the impression data of the online news media, 
Newtalk, provided by AviviD innovative media company. 
There are two kinds of datasets we will use.
News_list: The content of all push notifications(news) was collected in this dataset.
